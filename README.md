# before-pokemon

 In Pokemon-besides collecting various cute monsters-the aim is to have a team that can beat the gym leaders and collect their badges. To do that, it's important to know the type of Pokemon they have, that types of attacks they're vulnerable to and which hardly effects them.

...
But before Pokemon, there was Rock, Paper, Scissors. You can read more about the rules [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors)

Your task is to build a command-line version of this game using TDD and Clean Code principles. Below you'll find the criteria needed to pass and to earn a merit or distinction for this task.

You can absolutely ask for help, and you can explore ideas with each other; however, this is one of the few times where we ask you to submit your own work-it will help me understand what concepts you feel more comfortable with and where I can support you more.

You shouldn't need any external packages other than a code coverage library and pytest. Heavy use of additional libraries may be penalised.

## What Do I Need to do to Pass?
To show sufficent knowledge, you will need to demonstrate:

- You write tests first most of the time, and you code coverage is more than 60%
- You can demonstrate consistent use of Clean Code principles
- As a user, I am able to play a working game with the computer 

## What Does A Merit Look Like?
You will need to demonstrate the above, plus:

- You write tests first almost all the time
- You consistently looking to start with the smallest test, and your commits demonstrate a deliberate evolution of code.
- In the game, your code holds a list of matches and displays a simple win-loss stat for the user
-  Your test coverage is more than 80%

## What Does A Distinction Look Like?
You will need to demonstrate the above, plus:

- Your code can handle last-minute changes or additional requests.
- As a user, I can determine the number of rounds I want to play
- In the win-loss stat, the game displays the option most used by the player.
